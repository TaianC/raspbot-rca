Run the Arduino script generation tool, labeled clearly as "tool.py."
You will be asked to provide a path to your hardware configuration file (i.e C:/Users/pc1636/Raspbot RCA/client/hardware.cfg or /home/pc1636/Raspbot RCA/client/hardware.cfg).

Please make sure you have edited your hardware configuration file and changed it from its default settings.

The generation tool will create a script under the folder labeled "rca" to be uploaded.
To upload, plug the USB Type A plug on the USB A to USB B cable usually plugged into the Raspberry Pi into your computer and make sure the USB Type B plug is seated nicely into the Arduino's port.
Install the Arduino IDE or other tool such as PlatformIO and open the generated script file. Press the upload button after setting your board and uploader.

After uploading the script file, you may disconnect the Type A plug and plug it into the Raspberry Pi.
