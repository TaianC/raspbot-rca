## Instructions for Arduino Software
Run the Arduino script generation tool, labeled clearly as "tool.py."
You will be asked to provide a path to your hardware configuration file (i.e C:/Users/X/Raspbot RCA/client/hardware.cfg or /home/X/Raspbot RCA/client/hardware.cfg).

Please make sure you have edited your hardware configuration file to match your installed hardware.

The generation tool will create a script to be uploaded.

To upload, plug the USB Type A plug on the USB A to USB B cable usually plugged into the Raspberry Pi into your computer and make sure the USB Type B plug is seated nicely into the Arduino's port.

Compile and upload the generated source file with your favorite IDE.

After uploading the script file, you may disconnect the Type A plug and plug it into the Raspberry Pi.
